-Switch the validMoves array to an enum type

We need to figure out how to deal with out-of-bounds array accesses on the
validMoves functions in the various pieces. Do we have to deal woth it every
time and run an "is position in bounds?" check each time or is there some
better way to deal with it?

I think the change to a Board type may actually fix this if instead of inputting
values directly into an array we can call a getter/setter methods that take
position values (and possibly displacement) and can get/set and return a boolean
that denotes whether the attempted postion was valid (in bounds)
